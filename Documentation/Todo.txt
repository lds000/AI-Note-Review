Not working as expected.
	When editing ICD10segment, not reloading.
	When editing a tag and recheck note, not updating tag changes.
	Copy the Tag UC from the checkpoint editor to the main editor, or better yet, combine them into one user control
	Create little icons that hover over note elements that give suggestions. ! = danger, ? = ask, * = additional info
